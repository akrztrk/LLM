Contains explanatory documents, notes, and reference material about RAG concepts, design choices, and best practices.

## Scope of This Branch

This branch is focused on:
- Conceptual understanding of RAG
- Project structure and documentation
- Experiment notes and design decisions

It does **not** include:
- Model training code
- Inference pipelines
- Production-ready implementations

Those are handled in other branches.

---

## Next Steps

Planned future work includes:
- Building a minimal RAG pipeline
- Indexing documents with vector databases
- Comparing different retrieval strategies
- Integrating RAG with fine-tuned language models

---

## Notes

This branch is intentionally lightweight and documentation-driven to keep experiments isolated and easy to iterate on.
